# Terms of Use

Effective Date: March 22, 2018

Thanks for using Fieldstone Software LLC’s (“Fieldstone“) products and services (“Services”).

These Terms of Use (“TOU”) contain the terms under which Fieldstone and its affiliates provide their Services to you and describe how the Services may be accessed and used.

You indicate your agreement to these Terms by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance of these Terms, by executing a document that references them, or by using the Services.

If you will be using the Services on behalf of an organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.

1. Fees and Payments

1.1. Fees for Services. You agree to pay to Fieldstone any fees for each Service you purchase or use (including any overage fees), in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Service. Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through your account management page. Fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or when required by law.

1.2. Subscriptions. Some of our Services are billed on a subscription basis (we call these “Subscriptions”). This means that you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period is called a “billing cycle”). Billing cycles are typically monthly, quarterly or annual, depending on what subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription. Your Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel auto-renewal through your online account management page, or by contacting customer support. While we will be sad to see you go, you may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription at any time, in which case your Subscription will continue until the end of that billing cycle before terminating. You may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription immediately after the Subscription starts if you do not want it to renew.

1.3. Taxes. Unless otherwise stated, you are responsible for any taxes (other than Fieldstone’s income tax) or duties associated with the sale of the Services, including any related penalties or interest (collectively, “Taxes”). You will pay Fieldstone for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Fieldstone is obliged to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide Fieldstone with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority or other documentation providing evidence that no tax should be charged. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to Fieldstone, you must provide Fieldstone with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.

1.4. Price Changes. Fieldstone may change the fees charged for the Services at any time, provided that, for Services billed on a subscription basis, the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current billing cycle of your Subscription. Fieldstone will provide you with reasonable prior written notice of any change in fees to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the change becomes effective.

1.5. Overage Fees. Unless otherwise stated, any overage fees incurred by you will be billed in arrears. Overage fees which remain unpaid for 30 days after being billed are considered overdue. Failure to pay overage fees when due may result in the applicable Service being limited, suspended, or terminated (subject to applicable legal requirements), which may result in a loss of your data associated with that Service.

2. Privacy

2.1. Privacy. In the course of using the Services, you may submit content to Fieldstone (including your personal data and the personal data of others) or third parties may submit content to you through the Services (your “Content”). We know that by giving us your Content, you are trusting us to treat it appropriately. Fieldstone’s Privacy Policy, together with any privacy statements and privacy notices (collectively, “privacy policies”), detail how we treat your Content and personal data and we agree to adhere to those privacy policies. You in turn agree that Fieldstone may use and share your Content in accordance with our privacy policies.

2.2. Confidentiality. Fieldstone will treat your Content as confidential information and only use and disclose it in accordance with these Terms (including our privacy policies). However, your Content is not regarded as confidential information if such Content: (a) is or becomes public (other than through breach of these Terms by Fieldstone); (b) was lawfully known to Fieldstone before receiving it from you; (c) is received by Fieldstone from a third party without knowledge of breach of any obligation owed to you; or (d) was independently developed by Fieldstone without reference to your Content. Fieldstone may disclose your Content when required by law or legal process, but only after Fieldstone, if permitted by law, uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify you to give you the opportunity to challenge the requirement to disclose.

2.3. Security. Fieldstone will store and process your Content in a manner consistent with industry security standards. Fieldstone has implemented appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative systems, policies, and procedures designed to help ensure the security, integrity, and confidentiality of your Content and to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to or use of your Content.

3. Your Content

3.1. You Retain Ownership of Your Content. You retain ownership of all of your intellectual property rights in your Content. Fieldstone does not claim ownership over any of your Content. These Terms do not grant us any licenses or rights to your Content except for the limited rights needed for us to provide the Services, and as otherwise described in these Terms.

3.2. Limited License to Your Content. You grant Fieldstone a worldwide, royalty free license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, create derivative works, make publicly available, and otherwise exploit your Content, but only for the limited purposes of providing the Services to you and as otherwise permitted by Fieldstone’s privacy policies. This license for such limited purposes continues even after you stop using our Services, with respect to aggregate and de-identified data derived from your Content and any residual backup copies of your Content made in the ordinary course of Fieldstone’s business. This license also extends to any trusted third parties we work with to the extent necessary to provide the Services to you. If you provide Fieldstone with feedback about the Services, we may use your feedback without any obligation to you.

3.3. Customer Lists.  Fieldstone may identify you (by name and logo) as a Fieldstone customer on Fieldstone’s website and on other promotional materials. Any goodwill arising from the use of your name and logo will inure to your benefit.

3.4. Copyright Claims (DCMA Notices). Fieldstone Software, LLC responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement in accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If you believe that your work has been exploited in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify Fieldstone customer support.

3.5. Other IP Claims. Fieldstone respects the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect our users to do the same. If you believe a Fieldstone user is infringing upon your intellectual property rights, you may report it by contacting Fieldstone customer support. Claims of copyright infringement should follow the DMCA process outlined in these Terms, or any equivalent process available under local law.

4. Fieldstone IP

4.1. Fieldstone IP. Neither these Terms nor your use of the Services grants you ownership in the Services or the content you access through the Services (other than your Content).  These Terms do not grant you any right to use Fieldstone’s trademarks or other brand elements.

5. User Content

5.1. User Content. The Services display content provided by others that is not owned by Fieldstone. Such content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. Correspondingly, you are responsible for your own Content and you must ensure that you have all the rights and permissions needed to use that Content in connection with the Services. Fieldstone is not responsible for any actions you take with respect to your Content, including sharing it publicly. Please do not use content from the Services unless you have first obtained the permission of its owner, or are otherwise authorized by law to do so.

5.2. Content Review. You acknowledge that, in order to ensure compliance with legal obligations, Fieldstone may be required to review certain content submitted to the Services to determine whether it is illegal or whether it violates these Terms (such as when unlawful content is reported to us). We may also modify, prevent access to, delete, or refuse to display content that we believe violates the law or these Terms. However, Fieldstone otherwise has no obligation to monitor or review any content submitted to the Services.

5.3. Third Party Resources. Fieldstone may publish links in its Services to internet websites maintained by third parties. Fieldstone does not represent that it has reviewed such third party websites and is not responsible for them or any content appearing on them. Trademarks displayed in conjunction with the Services are the property of their respective owners.

6. Account Management

6.1. Keep Your Password Secure. If you have been issued an account by Fieldstone in connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for safeguarding your password and any other credentials used to access that account. You, and not Fieldstone, are responsible for any activity occurring in your account (other than activity that Fieldstone is directly responsible for which is not performed in accordance with your instructions), whether or not you authorized that activity. If you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account, you should notify Fieldstone immediately. Accounts may not be shared and may only be used by one individual per account.

6.2. Keep Your Details Accurate. Fieldstone occasionally sends notices to the email address registered with your account. You must keep your email address and, where applicable, your contact details and payment details associated with your account current and accurate. Accounts are controlled by the entity whose email address and or telephone number is registered with the account.

6.3. Remember to Backup. You are responsible for maintaining, protecting, and making backups of your Content. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Fieldstone will not be liable for any failure to store, or for loss or corruption of, your Content.

6.4. Account Inactivity. Fieldstone may terminate your account and delete any content contained in it if there is no account activity (such as a log in event or payment) for over 12 months. However, we will attempt to warn you by email before terminating your account to provide you with an opportunity to log in to your account so that it remains active.

6.5. Customer Success. Fieldstone may assign you a customer success manager (“CSM”). The CSM may review your use of the Services and your Content to help you to more effectively use the Services, including by providing reporting and usage insight.

7. User Requirements

7.1. Legal Status. If you are an individual, you may only use the Service if you have the power to form a contract with Fieldstone. None of the Services are intended for use by individuals less than 13 years old. If you are under 13 years old or do not have the power to form a contract with Fieldstone, you may not use the Services. We recommend that parents and guardians directly supervise any use of the Services by minors. If you are not an individual, you warrant that you are validly formed and existing under the laws of your jurisdiction of formation, that you have full power and authority to enter into these Terms, and that you have duly authorized your agent to bind you to these Terms. You represent and warrant that you will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your use of the Services.

7.2. Embargoes. You may only use the Services if you are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. If you are located in a country embargoed by United States or other applicable law from receiving the Services, or are on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List, or the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, you are not permitted to purchase any paid Services from Fieldstone. You will ensure that: (a) your end users do not use the Services in violation of any export restriction or embargo by the United States; and (b) you do not provide access to the Services to persons or entities on any of the foregoing lists.

8. Acceptable Uses

8.1. Legal Compliance. You must use the Services in compliance with, and only as permitted by, applicable law.

8.2. Your Responsibilities. You are responsible for your conduct, Content, and communications with others while using the Services. You must comply with the following requirements when using the Services:

(a) You may not purchase, use, or access the Services for the purpose of building a competitive product or service or for any other competitive purposes.

(b) You may not misuse our Services by interfering with their normal operation, or attempting to access them using a method other than through the interfaces and instructions that we provide.

(c) You may not circumvent or attempt to circumvent any limitations that Fieldstone imposes on your account.

(d) Unless authorized by Fieldstone in writing, you may not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any Fieldstone system or network.

(e) Unless authorized by Fieldstone in writing, you may not use any automated system or software to extract or scrape data from the websites or other interfaces through which we make our Services available.

(f) Unless permitted by applicable law, you may not deny others access to, or reverse engineer, the Services, or attempt to do so.

(g) You may not transmit any viruses, malware, or other types of malicious software, or links to such software, through the Services.

(h) You may not engage in abusive or excessive usage of the Services, which is usage significantly in excess of average usage patterns that adversely affects the speed, responsiveness, stability, availability, or functionality of the Services for other users. Fieldstone will endeavor to notify you of any abusive or excessive usage to provide you with an opportunity to reduce such usage to a level acceptable to Fieldstone.

(i) You may not use the Services to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or to commit an unlawful activity.

(j) Unless authorized by Fieldstone in writing, you may not resell or lease the Services.

(k) If your use of the Services requires you to comply with industry-specific regulations applicable to such use, you will be solely responsible for such compliance, unless Fieldstone has agreed with you otherwise. You may not use the Services in a way that would subject Fieldstone to those industry-specific regulations without obtaining Fieldstone’s prior written agreement. For example, you may not use the Services to collect, protect, or otherwise handle “protected health information” (as defined in 45 C.F.R. §160.103 under United States federal regulations) without entering into a separate business associate agreement with Fieldstone that permits you to do so.

9. Suspension and Termination of Services

9.1. By You. If you terminate a Subscription in the middle of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund for any period of time you did not use in that billing cycle unless you are terminating these Terms for any of the following reasons: (a) we have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after you have so notified us in writing; or (b) a refund is required by law.

9.2. By Fieldstone. Fieldstone may terminate your Subscription at the end of a billing cycle by providing at least 30 days’ prior written notice to you. Fieldstone may terminate your Subscription for any reason by providing at least 90 days’ written notice to you and will provide a pro rata refund for any period of time you did not use in that billing cycle. Fieldstone may suspend performance or terminate your Subscription for any of the following reasons: (a) you have materially breached these Terms and failed to cure that breach within 30 days after Fieldstone has so notified you in writing; (b) you cease your business operations or become subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days; or (c) you fail to pay fees for 30 days past the due date. Additionally, Fieldstone may limit or suspend the Services to you if you fail to comply with these Terms, or if you use the Services in a way that causes legal liability to us or disrupts others’ use of the Services. Fieldstone may also suspend providing the Services to you if we are investigating suspected misconduct by you. If we limit, suspend, or terminate the Services you receive, we will endeavor to give you advance notice and an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. However, there may be time sensitive situations where Fieldstone may decide that we need to take immediate action without notice. Fieldstone will use commercially reasonable efforts to narrow the scope and duration of any limitation or suspension under this Section as is needed to resolve the issue that prompted such action. Fieldstone has no obligation to retain your Content upon termination of the applicable Service.

9.3. Further Measures. If Fieldstone stops providing the Services to you because you repeatedly or egregiously breach these Terms, Fieldstone may take measures to prevent the further use of the Services by you, including blocking your IP address.

10. Changes and Updates

10.1. Changes to Terms. Fieldstone may change these Terms at any time for a variety of reasons, such as to reflect changes in applicable law or updates to Services, and to account for new Services or functionality. The most current version will always be posted on the Fieldstone website. If an amendment is material, as determined in Fieldstone’s sole discretion, Fieldstone will notify you by email. Notice of amendments may also be posted to Fieldstone’s blog or upon your login to your account. Changes will be effective no sooner than the day they are publicly posted. In order for certain changes to become effective, applicable law may require Fieldstone to obtain your consent to such changes, or to provide you with sufficient advance notice of them. If you do not want to agree to any changes made to the terms for a Service, you should stop using that Service, because by continuing to use the Services you indicate your agreement to be bound by the updated terms.

10.2. Changes to Services. Fieldstone constantly changes and improves the Services. Fieldstone may add, alter, or remove functionality from a Service at any time without prior notice. Fieldstone may also limit, suspend, or discontinue a Service at its discretion. If Fieldstone discontinues a Service, we will give you reasonable advance notice to provide you with an opportunity to export a copy of your Content from that Service. Fieldstone may remove content from the Services at any time in our sole discretion, although we will endeavor to notify you before we do that if it materially impacts you and if practicable under the circumstances.

11. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability

11.1. Disclaimers. While it is in Fieldstone’s interest to provide you with a great experience when using the Services, there are certain things we do not promise about them.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH OF Fieldstone, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF: (A) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO Fieldstone FOR USE OF THE SERVICES AT ISSUE DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY; AND (B) US$200.00.

11.4. Consumers. We acknowledge that the laws of certain jurisdictions provide legal rights to consumers that may not be overridden by contract or waived by those consumers. If you are such a consumer, nothing in these Terms limits any of those consumer rights.

11.5. Businesses. If you are a business, you will indemnify and hold harmless Fieldstone and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of a third party claim regarding or in connection with your or your end users’ use of the Services or breach of these Terms, to the extent that such liabilities, damages and costs were caused by you or your end users.

13.3. Independent Contractors. The relationship between you and Fieldstone is that of independent contractors, and not legal partners, employees, or agents of each other.

13.4. Interpretation. The use of the terms “includes”, “including”, “such as”, and similar terms, will be deemed not to limit what else might be included.
